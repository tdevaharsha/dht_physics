Physics Chapter 1: Units and Measurements

Important points

-There are three system of units: CGS, FPS, MKS

-SI units and quantities
Base quantity          Name           Symbol
Length                 Metre           m
Mass                   Kilogram        kg
Time                   Second          s
Electricity            Ampere          A
Thermodynamic          Kelvin          K
temperature
Amount of subtance     Mole            mol
Luminous intensity     Candela         cd

-The reliable digits plus the first uncertain digit are known as significant digits or significant figures.

-Rules of significant figures:
• All the non-zero digits are significant.
• All the zeros between two non-zero digits are significant, no matter where the decimal point is, if at all.
• If the number is less than 1, the zeros on the right of decimal point but to the left of the first non-zero digit are
not significant.
• The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a number without a decimal point are not significant.
• The trailing zero(s) in a number with a decimal point are significant.

-Rules for operations of significant figures:
(1)In multiplication or division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the
original number with the least significant figures.
(2)In addition or subtraction, the final result should retain as many decimal places as are there in the number
with the least decimal places.

-Errors

-Let a measurement bet taken carefully n times, if these measured values are a1, a2, a3....an, then their arithematic
mean is considered the most accurate value.

-If a set of experimental data is specified to n significant figures, a result obtained by combining the data will also
be valid to n significant figures.

-Accuracy measures closeness to the true value, while precision indicates consistency.

-Dimensions

The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers (or exponents) to which the base quantities are raised to represent
that quantity.

All the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M] and [T].

The magnitudes of physical quantities may be added together or subtracted from one another only if they have the same
dimensions.
